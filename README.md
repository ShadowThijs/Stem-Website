# Stem-Website
For my last year in highschool I had to make a thesis and since I study STEM, which is computer science oriented, I decided to make a website where I could present some of the other people in my class and their projects. Aswell give some information about what STEM exactly is and what you can expect when studying this. This was a very interesting project to say the least because I've never coded in HTML, css, JavaScript or SQL, which are some the coding languages that are mostly used when creating websites. So I had to start from the beginning so I'm going to include a tutorial on what exactly my plan was and how my journey to learn these coding languages went.

First I had to start to learn the basics of HTML and css to give my website a start. I'd recommend looking at w3schools.com tutorials around these, they are very well explained and are perfect for beginners like me. Just try to go through the course
